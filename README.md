# Webcodesk desktop application [DEPRECATED]

This repository contains the source code of the Webcodesk desktop application.

### What's inside?

There are two parts in Webcodesk: an Electron application, and a Single Page Web application.

Used tools and libraries:
* [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) - for cross platform desktop app.
* [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/) - building the binary executables.
* [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) - building a Web app bundle.
* [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) - UI components.
* [React App Framework](https://github.com/webcodesk/react-app-framework) - linking UI components with core logic.
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) - the source code parsing.
* [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) - the flow diagram presentation.

### The source code structure

* `public` - static files
* `src` - the source code root directory
    * `app` - react-app-framework configuration files
    * `electron` - Electron application files
    * `icons` - icons files
    * `usr`
        * `api` - functions lists used in flows
        * `commons` - global constants files
        * `components` - UI components

### How to build the application?

#### Development: run Web application and Electron app

* `yarn build`

> Run this command only if there were any changes in files from the `electron` directory.
